## **VibeCheck AI: Pre-Visualization for Experiential Spaces**

---

## **EXECUTIVE SUMMARY**

**Product Name:** VibeCheck AI  
**Tagline:** "See Your Experience Before You Build It"  
**Build Time:** 3-4 hours  
**Core Value:** Generate photorealistic previews of experiential spaces in minutes, not days—accelerating client approvals and creative iteration.

---

## **1. PROBLEM STATEMENT**

### **Pain Points:**
- Clients can't visualize experiential concepts from mood boards alone
- Traditional rendering takes 1-2 weeks per concept
- By the time renders are ready, creative direction has evolved
- Budget limitations prevent exploring multiple design variations
- Approvals get delayed, pushing back production schedules

### **Cost Analysis:**
- **Traditional Rendering:** $2-5K per concept, 1-2 weeks
- **VibeCheck AI:** $0-50 per concept, 10-30 minutes
- **ROI:** 100x faster, 50x cheaper, unlimited iterations

### **User Personas:**

**Persona 1: Creative Director**
- Needs: Quick visualization to sell concepts internally before expensive renders
- Pain: Can't afford to explore wild ideas without budget approval
- Goal: Present 10 variations instead of 2

**Persona 2: Client Stakeholder**
- Needs: See the space to understand the vision
- Pain: Mood boards are too abstract, can't get buy-in
- Goal: Make confident decisions faster

**Persona 3: Producer**
- Needs: Validate spatial layouts before fabrication
- Pain: Discovering flow issues during install is expensive
- Goal: Catch problems in preview stage

## **5. TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION**

### **AI Tool Stack:**

**Primary: Midjourney (via Discord API)**
```
Best for: Architectural spaces, lighting, composition
Pros: Best quality, most reliable
Cons: Requires Discord bot setup
Cost: $30/month subscription
Speed: 1-2 minutes per image
```

**Backup: Runway ML Gen-2**
```
Best for: Adding motion, crowd simulation
Pros: Video generation capability
Cons: More expensive, slower
Cost: Pay-per-generation
Speed: 3-5 minutes per clip
```

**Alternative: Stable Diffusion (ComfyUI)**
```
Best for: Full control, local generation
Pros: Free, unlimited generations
Cons: Requires technical setup, hit-or-miss quality
Cost: Free (if you have GPU)
Speed: 30 seconds - 2 minutes
```

**Recommended Approach for 12-Hour Build:**
Use **pre-generated images** for demo, show the process/methodology.

## **8. KEY JAVASCRIPT FUNCTIONALITY**

```javascript
// Image Gallery Core
class ImageGallery {
  constructor(images) {
    this.images = images;
    this.currentIndex = 0;
    this.init();
  }
  
  init() {
    this.setupKeyboardNav();
    this.setupTouchGestures();
    this.loadImage(0);
  }
  
  next() {
    this.currentIndex = (this.currentIndex + 1) % this.images.length;
    this.loadImage(this.currentIndex);
  }
  
  prev() {
    this.currentIndex = (this.currentIndex - 1 + this.images.length) % this.images.length;
    this.loadImage(this.currentIndex);
  }
  
  loadImage(index) {
    const img = this.images[index];
    // Fade out, swap, fade in
    this.animateTransition(img);
  }
}

// Comparison Slider
class ComparisonSlider {
  constructor(beforeImg, afterImg) {
    this.before = beforeImg;
    this.after = afterImg;
    this.setupSlider();
  }
  
  setupSlider() {
    // Draggable divider
    // Reveals before/after on drag
  }
}

// Image Preloading
function preloadImages(imageArray) {
  imageArray.forEach(src => {
    const img = new Image();
    img.src = src;
  });

**"How VibeCheck Works"**

```markdown
# The Process

## 1. Concept Definition
Creative teams provide:
- Space dimensions and layout requirements
- Brand guidelines and visual references
- Desired atmosphere and experience goals
- Budget constraints and timeline

## 2. Prompt Engineering
We translate creative briefs into detailed AI prompts:
- Spatial description (dimensions, layout)
- Material specifications (concrete, LED, fabric)
- Lighting scenarios (natural, dramatic, ambient)
- Atmospheric qualities (modern, warm, energetic)
- Brand integration (logos, colors, patterns)

## 3. AI Generation
Multiple AI models process prompts:
- Midjourney: Primary spatial visualization
- Runway ML: Motion and video elements
- DALL-E 3: Detail refinement
- Stable Diffusion: Custom variations

## 4. Curation & Enhancement
Human expertise refines outputs:
- Select best compositions
- Color correction for brand accuracy
- Add architectural annotations
- Create comparison views

## 5. Client Presentation
Deliver interactive gallery:
- Multiple viewing angles
- Day/night scenarios
- Material detail shots
- Annotated spatial layouts
- Downloadable assets

## Speed Comparison

Traditional Rendering:
- Kickoff meeting: Day 1
- Modeling: Days 2-5

## **10. DEMO SCRIPT FOR JESSE**

**Opening (30 seconds):**
"VibeCheck uses AI to generate photorealistic previews of experiential spaces in minutes. This solves a massive bottleneck: clients can't visualize concepts from mood boards, but traditional rendering takes weeks."

**Gallery Walkthrough (2 minutes):**
"Here are three Jack Morton-style projects. This AWS booth—I described the space in one paragraph, added AWS brand guidelines, and got these outputs in 10 minutes. See entrance view, interior wide shot, demo station details. Now look at day versus night lighting."

**Comparison Demo (1 minute):**
"Use this slider—left side is the original mood board, right side is AI visualization. Instantly clients see the vision. No more 'I can't picture it' feedback."

**Client Application (2 minutes):**
"Imagine pitch scenario: You need to present 5 booth concepts for Meta Connect. Traditionally, you'd pick 1-2 to render because of cost. With VibeCheck, generate all 5 in an afternoon. Client picks favorite, THEN invest in full production rendering."

**The Math (1 minute):**
"Traditional rendering: $3K per concept, 2 weeks. VibeCheck: $50 and 30 minutes. If Jack Morton does 50 pitches per year with 3 concepts each, that's $450K saved and 300 weeks of time gained. That's 6 years compressed into days."

**The Ask (30 seconds):**
"This is using today's AI tools. Imagine a custom version trained on Jack Morton's aesthetic, your past work, specific client brand guidelines. Want to pilot it?"
