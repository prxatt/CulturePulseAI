### **The Connection:**
- Jesse has strong Jack Morton ties and industry influence
- Jules Lennon (SVP at Jack Morton) recommended you
- You've worked with Jack Morton successfully before
- Jesse understands both agencies deeply = perfect bridge

---

## **YOUR POSITIONING STATEMENT**

**The One-Liner:**
*"I'm a Creative Producer who bridges traditional experiential excellence with emerging AI capabilities—I help brands create culturally-resonant experiences faster, smarter, and more impactfully than traditional workflows allow."*

**Why This Matters to Jesse:**
- NVE is in growth mode and needs production efficiency
- Jack Morton is expanding (Tokyo office, 50% YoY growth) = needs scalable solutions
- Both agencies face: shorter timelines, bigger client expectations, tighter budgets
- Your AI skills = competitive advantage for whichever agency hires you

---

## **OPENING: FIRST 2 MINUTES**

### **Your Opening Move:**

"Jesse, thanks so much for making time. Jules speaks incredibly highly of you, and I've been following your move to NVE—congrats on the COO role. 

I wanted to reconnect because since my time with Jack Morton as Production Coordinator, I've been obsessed with solving a problem I kept seeing: how do we create world-class experiential work at the speed and scale today's brands demand?

I've spent the last few years working with Meta, AWS, and other tech brands while simultaneously going deep on AI implementation for production workflows. I'm not here to just talk about getting back into experiential—I'm here to show you how I can help Jack Morton (or NVE) lead the next evolution of this industry.

I've built something I'd love to show you."

**Why This Works:**
- ✅ Acknowledges the relationship (Jules)
- ✅ Shows you've been paying attention (NVE COO role)
- ✅ Frames a problem, not a job ask
- ✅ Demonstrates evolution, not just experience
- ✅ Creates curiosity (what did you build?)

---

## **CORE TALKING POINTS**

### **1. Your Unique Value Proposition**

**Point:** "I'm uniquely positioned at the intersection of three critical skillsets:"

1. **Traditional Production Excellence**
   - "I've managed $1M+ budgets, led cross-functional teams, delivered under pressure"
   - "Jack Morton taught me experiential rigor—I know what world-class looks like"

2. **Emerging Tech Fluency**
   - "VR/AR production with PwC, 3D content for Meta, real-time experiences"
   - "I don't just spec tech—I produce with it"

3. **AI Implementation Expertise**
   - "I worked at OpenAI evaluating AI models—I understand the tech deeply"
   - "I've built AI-enhanced workflows that cut production time by 40%"

**Transition:** "Most creatives OR producers OR tech people. I'm all three. Let me show you what that enables..."

---

### **2. The AI Opportunity for Experiential (Industry Positioning)**

**Point:** "Experiential marketing is having its AI moment—but most agencies are approaching it wrong."

**The Problem:**
- "Everyone's talking about AI, but most applications are surface-level: chatbot assistants, basic image generation"
- "The real opportunity is using AI to enhance the creative *process*, not replace the creative *output*"

**The Opportunity:**
- **Faster Ideation:** "What if pitch concepts took 2 days instead of 2 weeks?"
- **Better Personalization:** "What if every activation could adapt to real-time cultural moments?"
- **Smarter Pre-Visualization:** "What if clients could *experience* spaces before they're built?"
- **Scalable Production:** "What if asset creation scaled without sacrificing quality?"

**Your Position:**
"I'm not pitching AI replacing creatives. I'm showing how AI amplifies what great creatives already do—making Jack Morton faster, smarter, and more culturally relevant than any competitor."

---

### **3. Specific Jack Morton Applications**

**Point:** "Here's exactly how this helps Jack Morton win and deliver..."

**Scenario A: Pitch Process**
- **Current:** 2-week turnaround for pitch concepts, 2-3 options presented
- **With AI:** 48-hour turnaround, 10 variations explored, client gets interactive previews
- **Result:** Higher win rate, happier clients, team focuses on strategy not execution

**Scenario B: Production Pipeline**
- **Current:** Design > render > revise > render > client feedback > revise (weeks)
- **With AI:** Real-time iteration, photorealistic previews in minutes, faster approvals
- **Result:** Shorten production cycles 30-40%, reduce costs, increase margin

**Scenario C: Cultural Relevance**
- **Current:** Manual trend research, delayed insights, activations feel dated
- **With AI:** Real-time cultural monitoring, predictive trend analysis, always-fresh concepts
- **Result:** Activations that feel "of the moment," stronger brand-culture connection

**Scenario D: Global Scalability**
- **Current:** Each market needs custom creative development
- **With AI:** Generate market-specific variations maintaining brand DNA
- **Result:** Support Tokyo expansion, scale without proportional headcount growth

**Your Proof:** "I've built working prototypes of these tools. Want to see?"

---

### **4. Why Jack Morton Specifically**

**Point:** "I want to work with Jack Morton because..."

1. **Proven Relationship**
   - "I've worked with the team before—I know the culture, the standards, the ambition"
   - "Jules wouldn't have connected us if she didn't think this was a strong fit"

2. **Industry Leadership Position**
   - "Jack Morton is THE experiential agency—Adweek AOY, global expansion, incredible client list"
   - "You don't go to the second-best when you want to do career-defining work"

3. **Cultural Fit**
   - "The 'Be Extraordinary' ethos resonates—I'm not interested in ordinary work"
   - "Jack Morton's approach to 'architecting branded cultures' is exactly where I think experiential is heading"

4. **Growth Trajectory**
   - "The Tokyo expansion, the major client wins—this is an agency on the move"
   - "I want to be part of that growth, not watch it from the sidelines"

5. **Remote Opportunity**
   - "I work across SF, NY, and Tokyo already—remote doesn't mean disconnected"
   - "I've delivered $1M+ projects fully remotely, managed distributed teams successfully"

**The Ask:**
"I'm not looking for just any job. I'm looking to help Jack Morton maintain its leadership position as experiential enters the AI era. I think I can do that. What's the path forward?"

---

### **5. Addressing Potential Concerns**

**Concern: "Why remote?"**

**Your Answer:**
"Great question. A few reasons:
1. Geographic flexibility lets me support multiple offices (SF, NY, Tokyo)
2. Clients are global—I'm already working across time zones effectively
3. Production is increasingly distributed—I've managed remote teams delivering world-class work
4. Results matter more than location—happy to prove this with a project

That said, I'm not opposed to being on-site for key moments: pitch weeks, production launches, team offsites. I see remote as *flexibility*, not *absence*."

---

**Concern: "Why now? Why this role?"**

**Your Answer:**
"Honest answer: I've been building these AI capabilities for the past few years across tech clients, but I've realized the most exciting application is experiential marketing. 

Traditional tech companies want incremental improvements. Experiential agencies like Jack Morton can *leapfrog* the industry with this technology.

The timing is perfect: Jack Morton is expanding, AI is mature enough to be practical, and I'm at the exact career point where I can contribute strategically, not just executionally."

---

**Concern: "We're not sure we need AI expertise..."**

**Your Answer:**
"Totally fair. Let me reframe: I'm not an 'AI person.' I'm a Creative Producer who happens to have AI as one of many tools.

Think of it like this: 10 years ago, someone who deeply understood social media had an advantage. Today, it's AI fluency.

I can produce world-class experiential work *without* AI. But WITH it, I can help Jack Morton do things competitors literally can't. That's valuable regardless of whether you think you need it right now.

Plus—competitors are experimenting with this too. Better to be ahead than playing catch-up in 18 months."

---

**Concern: "What's your availability? Timeline?"**

**Your Answer:**
"I can start immediately. I'm currently freelancing, which gives me flexibility.

Ideal scenario: We align on scope, I start on a project basis to prove value, and if it's a mutual fit, we formalize full-time remote.

Or, if you prefer: I start full-time right away with a clear 90-day roadmap of what I'll deliver.

Either way, I'm ready to jump in and contribute from day one."

---

## **DEMO PRESENTATION STRUCTURE**

### **Introduction (30 seconds):**
"I've built three proof-of-concepts showing how AI can transform experiential production. Each solves a real Jack Morton problem. Let me walk you through..."

### **Demo #1: [Your Chosen Concept] (3-4 minutes):**
- **The Problem:** State it clearly
- **The Solution:** Show the tool/concept
- **The Impact:** Quantify the value
- **The Application:** "Here's how Jack Morton uses this tomorrow..."

### **Demo #2: [Your Second Concept] (3-4 minutes):**
- Same structure
- Different use case
- Show versatility

### **Demo #3 OR Vision Statement (2 minutes):**
Either show third demo OR paint the bigger picture:
"These are just starting points. Imagine if Jack Morton had an entire AI-enhanced production suite—what would that unlock?"

### **Conclusion (1 minute):**
"This isn't theoretical. It's working. And I can start building this for Jack Morton immediately. What questions do you have?"

## **POWERFUL QUESTIONS TO ASK JESSE**

*Great questions show strategic thinking and genuine interest:*

1. **About NVE/Jack Morton Relationship:**
   "You've worked at Jack Morton and now lead NVE—what do you see as the key differentiators between top experiential agencies right now?"

2. **About Industry Evolution:**
   "Where do you think experiential marketing is heading in the next 2-3 years? What capabilities will separate leaders from followers?"

3. **About Production Challenges:**
   "What are the biggest production bottlenecks you see agencies facing? Where do projects typically slow down?"

4. **About Team Structure:**
   "How is Jack Morton structuring creative teams to handle the increasing pace and complexity of client demands?"

5. **About Technology Adoption:**
   "How is Jack Morton thinking about emerging tech—VR, AR, AI—in their production workflows? Is there an innovation team?"

6. **About Your Potential Role:**
   "If I joined Jack Morton, what would success look like in the first 90 days? What problems would you want me solving immediately?"

7. **About Jules' Perspective:**
   "Jules has been so supportive—what specifically made her think we should connect? What did she see as the opportunity?"

8. **About Next Steps:**
   "What's the typical process for bringing on someone in this capacity? Are we talking direct hire, project-to-hire, or something else?"

---

## **OBJECTION HANDLING MATRIX**

### **"We're not hiring right now"**

**Response:**
"I completely understand. A few thoughts:

First, I'm not asking you to create a role—I'm offering to solve problems you already have. Maybe that's a contractor engagement to start.

Second, fast-growing agencies like Jack Morton often find that the right person at the right time is worth making space for.

Third, even if timing isn't right today, I'd love to stay connected. If this work resonates, there might be future opportunities—or I could be a resource for specific projects.

What feels most realistic to you?"

---

### **"This feels too technical/niche"**

**Response:**
"I hear you—and that's actually why I wanted to meet. I'm not pitching myself as a 'tech specialist.' 

I'm a Creative Producer who happens to have these additional capabilities. Think of me as someone who can:
- Lead traditional production workflows ✓
- Manage cross-functional teams ✓  
- Deliver experiential excellence ✓
- PLUS bring AI/tech augmentation when it adds value

The AI stuff isn't separate from the job—it makes the core job better, faster, stronger."

---

### **"We already have a production team"**

**Response:**
"That's great—strong production is foundational. I'm not looking to replace anyone.

I see this more as:
1. **Augmenting capacity** during peak periods or major pitches
2. **Bringing specialized capabilities** (VR/AR, AI-enhanced workflows) that complement existing team
3. **Future-proofing operations** as client expectations evolve

Happy to start as a specialist contributor and grow from there based on where I can add most value."

---

### **"Remote doesn't work for our culture"**

**Response:**
"I appreciate culture fit is critical. A few counter-points:

1. **Proven Track Record:** I've managed $1M+ projects remotely with teams across SF, NY, Tokyo—delivery hasn't suffered
2. **Hybrid Flexibility:** I travel regularly and can be on-site for critical moments (pitches, production launches, team weeks)
3. **Industry Reality:** Many of your clients (Meta, AWS) operate distributed teams successfully
4. **Trial Period:** What if we start with a project engagement? If remote doesn't work, we'll know quickly

Most importantly: I'm optimizing for *impact*, not location. If being on-site more often drives better results, I'm flexible."

---

### **"Your experience is great, but we need someone more senior"**

**Response:**
"Tell me more about what 'more senior' means to you. Is it:
- Years of experience? (I have 8+ years in production)
- Budget size managed? (I've delivered $1M+ projects)
- Team leadership? (I've led cross-functional teams across orgs)
- Strategic contribution? (Let me show you the strategic frameworks I've built)

I might be positioning myself wrong. Help me understand what seniority looks like for this role, and I can show you where I meet or exceed those expectations."

---

### **"We're focused on traditional experiential, not tech/AI"**

**Response:**
"Perfect—me too. I love that experiential is fundamentally about *human connection*.

The AI tools I've built aren't about making experiences more 'tech-y.' They're about:
- Giving creatives more time to think strategically (less time rendering)
- Helping clients approve concepts faster (better visualization)
- Making experiences more culturally relevant (real-time trend data)
- Producing more work with same resources (efficiency, not replacement)

Think of it like this: Adobe didn't make design less creative—it made designers more productive. Same principle here.

The work still needs to make people *feel* something. Technology is just how we get there better."

---

## **ALTERNATIVE PATHS IF JACK MORTON DOESN'T PAN OUT**

### **Path 1: NVE Direct**
If Jack Morton timing isn't right, pivot to NVE:
"Since you're now at NVE, would it make sense to explore how I could support your team there? I'd love to learn more about your production capabilities and where I might fit."

### **Path 2: Project-Based Start**
"What if I took on a specific project first—either for Jack Morton or NVE? Gives both sides a low-risk way to test the fit."

### **Path 3: Network Expansion**
"Are there others in your network I should connect with? I'm specifically looking for agencies doing cutting-edge experiential work who might value these capabilities."

### **Path 4: Stay-in-Touch Strategy**
- Follow Jesse on LinkedIn, engage thoughtfully with his posts
- Share relevant articles about AI in experiential marketing (tag him occasionally)
- Every 3-4 months, send a brief update: "Here's what I've been building..."
- When he posts about NVE wins, congratulate genuinely
